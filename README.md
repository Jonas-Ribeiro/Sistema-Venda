## About me

I'm a backend developer since 2018, often improving my skills in .Net

## SistemaVenda (Sale System)

This repository is about a course that I did on Udemy, there I learned a design pattern called DDD (Domain Driven Design), some .net core features, Entity Framework and
a cool javascript chart.

In this course I created a store web system, there you can register a customer, a product, product categories and sales. Also you can manage all this things.

The code is in portuguese, but I'm working to traslate it to english :smile:    

Feel free to contact me!
